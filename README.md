# WindowsPowerShell

Welcome! This repository is designed to hold PowerShell profiles, modules, and scripts for easy back-up and re-use.

## Instructions

Clone this repository in your documents folder. If the directory folder `WindowsPowerShell` already exists and is not empty, rename it - otherwise the clone will fail. Once the repo is cloned, you can copy any existing profiles, modules, and scripts from the renamed directory into the newly cloned directory.

If your existing profile, module, or script names match, you will have to manually merge the files.
