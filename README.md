# WindowsPowerShell Profiles

Welcome! This repository is designed to hold PowerShell profiles for easy back-up and re-use.

## Instructions

Clone this repository in your documents folder. If the directory folder `WindowsPowerShell` already exists, rename it so that it is not overwritten. Once the repo is cloned, you can copy any existing profiles from the renamed directory into the newly cloned directory.

If your existing profile names match, you will have to manually merge the files.
